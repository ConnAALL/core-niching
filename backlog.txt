High Prority:
1 - make logging work well
2 - I think core_controller.py is still using a CGA, cut that 
3 - Xpilots switchbase 1.0 option actually works, but it doesnt work in xpilots_mod, I probs have to ask Jim to help fix this
4 - make a script that starts xpilots mod server

Low Prority:
1 - Figure out what the deal with core_mod.xp is
