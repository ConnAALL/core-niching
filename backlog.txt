High Prority:

1 - change tracking to 8 feelers, one for each 45 degrees
2 - change heading to 2 feelers, one for 30 degrees around the face, see pic on ur phone
3 - add bit that makes turning and thrusting mutally exclusive in aciton gene

Low Prority:

1 - Make it so that when a new server is started, make a new folder to store the data from this new run in
2 - Have everything logged into a master csv every 60 seconds for a cool graph at the end
3 - Need to fix storage, the linux systems here dont have a lot of storage, so I need to start saving stuff to temp and then taking the data and putting it on my usbs before they get wiped. Also I can def write less stuff to the CSVS.
4 - before project goes public, give tools and instructions for people to compile xpilots mod on their own device
5 - a good way to test agents fitness is in the last paragraph in 6.0 in the core journal paper
I think this might be an issue:


Maybe: 
1 - maybe add left right turn cond in action gene, probs bad idea tho

Bugfixes:

Notes: 
1 - Original xpilot paper had firerepeatrate at 5, this one has it at 20 so 4 times as slow, I think thats better but just remember its changed
