0 - Run the test im running overnight to see if there is any crashes, if not LFG I did it
1 - Xpilots switchbase 1.0 option actually works, but it doesnt work in xpilots_mod, I probs have to ask Jim to help fix this
2 - Make it so that when a new server is started, make a new folder to store the data from this new run in

4 - Have everything logged into a master csv every 60 seconds for a cool graph at the end
