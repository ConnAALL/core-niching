High Prority:
\/ the "how strange" part of below might be fixed, gotta run tests overnight to see 
-2: agent instantly crashes if it runs into its own bullet, huge issue (this happens because a message stating "how strange" is said in chat).
specifically "agent x was killed by agent x, how strange!". Also, I want to see if this is an issue on xpilots aswell, or if its just xpilots_mod. 
I also want to see all of the messages being sent, so I know if any of the other ones are messsing up.
-1: make chrom map log to csv in real time, so I can figure what the hell is going wrong.
0 - Okay so controllers keep crashing because the stupid mapping isnt working properly because someone decided it would be a good idea to use a pointless
network and json files instead of awesome csv files im so pissed. I might just have to rewrite chrom_map idk, the alternative is to figure out the stupid 
bs reason the json decoder keeps deciding None types exist where there is clearly numbers. why is the codebase set up like this >:(. 
1 - make logging work well (Ie: different folders for each run, different data folders for each run, 
different tracebacks, organize agents by quadrant)
2 - then, when its logging stuff properly, get it to track agents avg time spent alive, avg kills, avg runs into walls,
etc, organized by quadrant, in csv, due to the way this is set up, we arent actually going to be going by bot names, we go by chromesome names (I think),
3 - make your csvs into cool graphs
4 - send to parker
5 - put the agents niched one way into differnet quadrants, see what happens

Low Prority:
1 - Xpilots switchbase 1.0 option actually works, but it doesnt work in xpilots_mod, I probs have to ask Jim to help fix this

I think this might be an issue:
1 - I think core_controller.py is still using a CGA, cut that if it is
