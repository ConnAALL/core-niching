High Prority:

1 - Make it so that when a new server is started, make a new folder to store the data from this new run in
2 - Have everything logged into a master csv every 60 seconds for a cool graph at the end
3 - Need to fix storage, the linux systems here dont have a lot of storage, so I need to start saving stuff to temp and then taking the data and putting it on my usbs before they get wiped. Also I can def write less stuff to the CSVS.
4 - before project goes public, give tools and instructions for people to compile xpilots mod on their own device
5 - a good way to test agents fitness is in the last paragraph in 6.0 in the core journal paper

Low Prority:

1 - Some agents still crash after running for a very long time, some don't though. I can't tell if its the com 212 kids touching the computer or python messing up or something because I ran super similiar tests on similiar machines, some crashed and some didint. I guess the best solution to this is launching an agent with the same name when an agent crashes, shouldnt be a huge deal because this happens so infrequently, like 0-3 times over 24 hrs usually. Last time 1 3, 1 1, 2 0.

I think this might be an issue:


Maybe: 


Bugfixes:

Notes: 
1 - Original xpilot paper had firerepeatrate at 5, this one has it at 20 so 4 times as slow, I think thats better but just remember its changed
