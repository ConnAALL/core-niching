High Prority:

1 - add "testing_fitness.py" file, we can test chromosomes by pulling the chromosome from an existing csv that we place in a "testing fitness"
folder, we then log the fitness to a fitness logging csv in a different folder, that folder isnt version control tracked, instead of logging on birth,
log every 1 minute, so we can compare agents performance on a graph. Before logging but after pulling the chromosome, check if we have 
already logged for this test, if so pull the time, so we can start running again if the run has stopped. 
2 - make an sh file using testing fitness that sets up a fitness competition between niched and not niched agents.
