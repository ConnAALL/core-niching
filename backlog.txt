High Prority:

0 - 99% im not gonna get the network implementation to never have any agents crash. its def closer than it was before, but its probably
better to just make every agent its own csv file. way easier to read chromosomes that way, agents are tied to their own evolution histories, 
and thats your logging pretty much taken care of, might be a little messy though, probably should log everything to a master csv at the same time,
for the logging purposes, then have it capture the latest info from all every 60 seconds, so it can have a graph of how each species evovled over the rounds.
0.5 - make evolution work way better, crossover is working in a weird way, I think its mutating every time, and I dont even know 
exactly how it works, it needs to make sense to a point where it not only works well but I could do an extensive writeup about it.
also unless this next test proves me wrong, i think that it doesnt evolve a way to detect walls at all, that or it isnt mutating enough or 
is mutating too much I littearly do not know.
1 - make logging work well (Ie: different folders for each run, different data folders for each run, 
different tracebacks, organize agents by quadrant)
2 - then, when its logging stuff properly, get it to track agents avg time spent alive, avg kills, avg runs into walls,
etc, organized by quadrant, in csv, due to the way this is set up, we arent actually going to be going by bot names, we go by chromesome names (I think),
3 - make your csvs into cool graphs
4 - send to parker
5 - put the agents niched one way into differnet quadrants, see what happens

Low Prority:
1 - Xpilots switchbase 1.0 option actually works, but it doesnt work in xpilots_mod, I probs have to ask Jim to help fix this
2 - Make something that logs all of the messages being sent, so I know if any of the other ones are messsing up the evolver.
3 - I want to test this more but I think turning off SDing will make the agents do better, thats what it looked like in one 
of the tests I did but I want to run these more to check

I think this might be an issue:
1 - I think core_controller.py is still using a CGA, cut that if it is
