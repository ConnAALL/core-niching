High Prority:
0 - Fix the core_teams map
1 - Bring back either CGA implementation or expert system where we evolve weights
2 - Make it so that when a new server is started, make a new folder to store the data from this new run in
3 - Have all agents frozen until all agents have spawned in, then SD all agents before starting the test
4 - Have everything logged into a master csv every 60 seconds for a cool graph at the end
5 - A lazy brute force way to fix agent timeouts would be to have launch_team_agents called every time a disconnection happens,
which I think would have be detected in the same window the server is run in so who knows how that would work out. Also
I guess if your doing it that way might as well just make it launch the exact agent that got timed out.
Low Prority:

I think this might be an issue:
1 - I think agents are worse at aiming now but that could be my imagination

Bugfixes:
1 - Agents still crashing, might just fix itself when I redo controller
